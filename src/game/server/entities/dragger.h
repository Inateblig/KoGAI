/**
 * Draggers generate dragger beams which pull players towards their center similar to a tractor beam
 *
 * A dragger will only generate one dragger beam per team for the closest player for whom the following criteria are met:
 * - The player is within the dragger range (sv_dragger_range).
 * - The player is not a super player
 * - The dragger is activated
 * - The dragger beam to be generated is not blocked by laser stoppers (or solid blocks if IgnoreWalls is set to false)
 * With the exception of solo players, for whom a dragger beam is always generated, regardless of the rest of the team,
 * if the above criteria are met. Solo players have no influence on the generation of the dragger beam for the rest
 * of the team.
 * A created dragger beam remains for the selected player until one of the criteria is no longer fulfilled. Only then
 * can a new dragger beam be created for that team, which may drag another team partner.
